  # PER KEY (`mergeTree`'s `ownUnmatched`), so handing them straight to `freeform.merge` would give it
  # n single-key defs → its `foldl' (//)` key-union and per-key `concatMap` both go O(n²). Coalescing
  # rebuilds the per-module shape (byte-identical output): group the unmatched defs by originating
  # MODULE INSTANCE (a threaded index — NOT `_file`: distinct anonymous modules share the
  # `<gen-merge>` fallback file yet must stay SEPARATE defs for priority resolution), then emit one
  # wide def per module in ASCENDING index order. Ascending index = reverse-module order (topDefs is
  # `pushedRev`), which is the order nixpkgs collects defs in (last module first) — load-bearing for
  # list-typed freeform values, order-independent for scalars/attrsets.
  #
  # Within a module the unmatched paths are DISJOINT, so its subtree is assembled in one pass: depth-1
  # keys (the wide-freeform hot path) build via `listToAttrs` — O(width) — and the deeper keys
  # (undeclared UNDER a declared group) fold via `recursiveUpdate`. That fold is O(deep-entries ×
  # subtree-width) (each `recursiveUpdate` copies its LHS), fine only because deeper freeform is BOTH
  # rare AND narrow on the den surface — a WIDE nested freeform group would want the same listToAttrs
  # treatment, but no consumer needs it. A depth-1 head and a deeper head can never collide within one

  # module can reach `config` regardless of its visible formals, and the post-application content is
  # always a plain attrset that no longer reveals whether config was reachable.
  #
  # Consequently `builtins.functionArgs` CANNOT prove a function module clean: `args@{ genSchema, ... }:
  # args.config` reports only `genSchema` yet the `@`-binding captures the full argument set, and a bare

  # ── the merge fold (shared by evalModuleTree options + the collection strategies) ──
  # Public (loc,type,rawDefs) contract — NON-short-circuiting, byte-for-byte the pre-kernel fold, so
  # every existing consumer of the exported `mergeDefs` escape hatch (spec §1 item 6) is unchanged.
  # The opt-in fixed-input path is `mergeDefsWith true`, reached ONLY through the evalModuleTree knob.
  #
  # This is the VALUE-ONLY fold — the hot path the structural strategies (attrsOf/listOf/submodule
  # per-element merges) and the escape hatch ride. It allocates NO provenance: the always-on channel
  # (A2 spec §1) is produced by the SEPARATE `mergeDefsRichWith` below, which the realizer invokes ONLY
  # for the top-level DECLARED options, so a config's thousands of structural sub-merges pay nothing
  # for a channel they never surface. The two folds share `mergeLeaf`; their discharge/priority/verify
  # spines are deliberately kept parallel (the provenance suite's value assertions + the oracle guard
  # against drift), because routing the structural hot path through the rich `{ value; prov }` record
  # measurably regresses the collection workloads (a per-element record thrown away unread).
  #
  #   rawDefs :: [{ file; value }]   (value may carry mkMerge/mkIf/mkOverride)
  # Discharge properties → filterOverrides (min-priority wins) → dispatch: a structural type owns its
  # combine via `.merge`; a leaf (gen-types checker, no `.merge`) merges by mergeLeaf then `verify`.
  # With `coreShortCircuit` it additionally honours the fixed-input core marker (spec §2.5), checked
  # BEFORE discharge:
  #   • SOLE core def at this loc  → return its `values` directly, skipping discharge/fold/verify —
  #     by contract already the full-merge output, so the result is byte-identical where the core is
  #     correct (a WRONG core surfaces here as a divergent value; the gate teeth catch it).
  #   • core def + ANY other def   → conservative fall-through: unwrap each core marker to its
  #     `values` as a plain def and run the normal spine (correctness over the skip). Byte-identical
  #     to a config that had supplied `values` in place of the marker.

  # FORCING CONTRACT: reading ANY field of the record (`defs`/`winners`/`priority`/`defaulted`) forces
  # this loc's contributing defs to WHNF — the record reads `discharged`, and `dischargeProperties`
  # branches on `isAttrs`, so a bare-`throw` def fires even on a plain `.defs` read (the SAME discharge
  # the value path runs to resolve priorities). What it does NOT force is the merged VALUE: the
  # structural `.merge` / leaf `verify` / `apply` live on the value path (`checked`), never reached by a
  # prov read. So provenance forces WHO-defined-what to WHNF, never the resolved value. (Weaker than
  # nixpkgs `definitionsWithLocations`, which forces nothing — byte-mode discharges eagerly for priority.)

  #   • winners   — the defs the priority pass kept (the merge's actual inputs).
  #   • priority  — the effective (min) priority the filter selected (`highestPrio`).
  #   • defaulted — the synthetic option `default` (`file = "<default>"`, appended by `mergeOptionWith`)
  #                 is the SOLE surviving winner ⇒ nobody else set the option (the `<default>` def won).
