# Purity invariant (design spec §5): the gen-merge library (./lib) is nixpkgs-lib-free — it is the
# REPLACEMENT for `lib.evalModules` + `lib.types`-merge, so it must never CALL them. It depends only
# on gen-prelude (+ the injected gen-types leaf checkers). A stray `lib.`/`lib.types`/`evalModules`/
# `nixpkgs` in the library source fails CI.
#
# NB gen-merge legitimately DEFINES `mkOption`/`mkOptionType`/`mkMerge` (its own API — the nixpkgs
# replacements), so those bare tokens are NOT forbidden; only the nixpkgs TETHER is. `evalModules`
# is safe to forbid — it is not an infix of gen-merge's own `evalModuleTree`.
#
# Scope: lib/**.nix + the root flake.nix + default.nix. NOT ci/ (the harness + the oracle's
# reference side legitimately use nixpkgs.lib).

  # marker, and that cut is sound only while the `#` it cuts at stands OUTSIDE a string literal.
  # Where it does not, live code is truncated to the end of that line and every cell below goes
  # blind on what was removed, with no signal at all — a green suite over source nothing scanned.
  #
  # The predicate asks the strip ITSELF where it cut: `stripComments` of a single line is exactly
  # the text before that line's cut. It then asks whether that text closed every double quote it
  # opened, an odd count meaning the cut stands inside a string. Deriving it from `stripComments`
  # rather than restating the cut rule is what keeps premise and strip from drifting apart when one
  # of them is edited, and it is why one block serves both strip families in this ecosystem.
  #
  # It is LINE-LOCAL and so cannot conclude about string content that spans lines — an indented
