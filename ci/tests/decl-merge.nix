# DECLARATION MERGE — one option loc declared by more than one module.
#
# The value side of the rule; the refusal MESSAGES are cells on the second output
# (`../tests-error.nix`), since `tryEval` discards the text. Three things are asserted here:
#
#   1. the ROUTING — a redeclared leaf's type is `typeMerge`'s answer about the pair, and the
#      library's own algebra is what decides it (the same table, read directly, sits beside the
#      routed one so a passing routing row cannot be read as the algebra having been bypassed);
#   2. the DISCRIMINATION — pairs that merge still evaluate, and a module that layers a field onto
#      an earlier typed leaf without declaring a type of its own is not a redeclaration at all;
#   3. RECOVERABILITY — where the ordered fold biases a non-type field, what it shadowed is still
#      reachable. Before this rule the overridden declaration was reachable from NOWHERE on the
#      result: sweeping every surface of a two-declaration eval for the losing default matched
#      nothing, with the winner's own default matching in the same sweep as the live control.
